Unit 14 homework on intro to javascript

## Background:

EThe purpose of this project is create a website for users to dynamically sort (filter) ufo sighting data based on a selected date. This is UFO-level-1. (Part two was to add in additional filters, which has not been accomplished or attempted, which would be UFO-level-2.)  The data collected includes date witnessed (datetime), city, state, country, shape of sighting, duration of sighting, and additional comments.  

Started code was provided that included the index.html and data.js files as well as images and style.css files.

## Technologies:
Becuase the homework came with many files (and technologies) already included, the challenge was to complete the app.js file.  e.g. technologies were already included.

## Steps for completion:
Create a basic HTML web page or use the [index.html](StarterCode/index.html) file provided.  Then, using the provided data set which consists of form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code shows that data on a webpage.  Make the page dynamic and interactive by adding in a date filter for the user to limit the amount of data lines based on a selected date. The website should:
1. Populate with all data upon opening.
2. Filter to just data from a selected date after the Filter Table button is clicked. (e.g. event lister on click.)  If a date is not selected in the data set, a notification should show that no data could be returned.  The user should be able to return to viewing all data if the selected date is deleted and the Filter button clicked.
